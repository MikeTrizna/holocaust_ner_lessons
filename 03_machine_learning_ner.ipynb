In the case of NER, we train a system with a series of texts with the entities appropriately annotated with their corresponding labels. **Unsupervised learning** occurs when you don't know the categories of your data. You give the system a series of data and allow it to learn and identify patterns on its own. This is most popularly used for topic modeling and k-means (beyond the scope of this notebook). Finally, there is **semi-supervised learning** which falls between these two.\n",
